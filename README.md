# What social problem are you working on?
    We are working on Mental Health Awareness

# Brief Description of your idea:
    Covid-19 has stressed everyone out of their mind. With the protest for various
    social justice issues and remote learning & work our mental health has been
    thrown out of whack and out of focus as we pay attention to our physical health.
    The Covid-19 Pandemic can potentially affect your physical health, but it has
    definitely affected everyoneâ€™s mental health. We wanted to remind everyone to
    take care of their mind as much as they do their bodies. It's the need of the hour
    to let positivity flow in. So our website aims at providing the people a zone out
    space from this pandemic and helps them to fill their mind with a surge of positive
    and enthusiastic thoughts thus turning their mindset into a positive one and
    helping them recover faster.

# Our website will mainly have three elements such as:
    1. Motivational quotes
    2. A section for sharing personal experience
    3. Counselor section

# Tech Stack that you will use and brief description of how will you go about making the project.
    We are mainly using HTML, CSS, With some Basic JS in order to make our website .
    We will be diving our tasks and all the three members will be working on three
    different components of the website. One will be working on homepage the other
    on blog page and so on. Talking about contents we will be getting a little help
    from the Google and W3Schools.com as well.

# Describe various use cases of your projects and future scope.
    One website mainly provides an escape to people from negative mindset and
    helps them grow positive thoughts which is helpful in mental as well as physical
    recovery of a person. Features which we offer are mainly:
    1. Blogs - A common place to share personal positive experience
    2. Counselors - One can contact counselors in case he/she needs real help
