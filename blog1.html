                <p>Hi , I am sumit, a resident of Kalyan and this is a blog sharing my experiences with the virus. I went out to buy some essentials on 25th of March , took all the necessary precautions but I don’t know how I contracted the virus. I started
                    showing symptoms and had 102 fever and my body ached. After two days I had a sore throat to such an extent that I wasn’t even able to eat food. Then I consulted a doctor and after hearing out the symptoms he suspected I had Covid and
                    sent me for a test via an ambulance. I felt very strange as I only went for a normal check up and I wasn’t ready for this but the doctor advised not to worry and get tested as it will make things clear. For two days I was kept in the
                    suspect ward and a swab test was done. Thank god they weren’t as painful as I thought it would be! I was quite shocked when my reports were out cause I thought it to be viral and also I had signs of recovery but I tested POSITIVE.</p>
                <p>I was then shifted to the positive ward. Doctors started with the line of action and I was provided with paracetamols and immunity boosters. I was advised to drink warm water but I wasn’t able to drink it because of my sore throat. Doctor
                    asked me to drink as much water as I can if I could not go with warm water (Say 5-7 litres a day). I ate fruits like apples and oranges to boost my immunity. </p>
                <p>After five days I started showing signs of recovery. Doctors always kept checking on us and made us feel better everyday. There was a psychiatrist named Dr. Aliya who helped us very much mentally to fight this virus. She helped a lot in
                    coping up with the stress caused due to our health conditions.
                </p>
                <p>After nine days the doctor asked me if I still had any symptoms and was discharged after I tested negative. Hats off to the doctors and the entire team for giving in all their time and efforts and keeping us as the utmost priority. On
                    the day of discharge I was provided with all the guidelines that I needed to follow. </p>
